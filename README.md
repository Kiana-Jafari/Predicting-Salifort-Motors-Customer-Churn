This Scenario goes on working for Salifort Motors. Salifortâ€™s senior leadership team is concerned about how many employees are leaving the company. So the leadership team asks to analyze the survey data and come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. To help with this, they suggest designing whether a statistical model such as Logistic regression, or any machine learning models such as decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, or even both, that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their job title, department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other relevant data points.
