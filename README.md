Recently, I earned a **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate**, during which I completed a technical project on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. This project used customer demographics, call center data, and phone usage data to predict whether a customer would cancel their service plan or not. After running several machine learning models, I noticed that customers who called the call center for support more than three times or had a family plan were seven times more likely to churn. Based on these findings, I recommended the stakeholders gather survey feedback about the quality of support customers are receiving from the call center and implement a money-saving promotion for customers on family plans. I feel this project aligns well with the open position in providing analysis for how to retain customers.
